## 🚧 What's my current work ?

* Passionate by [Trackmania 🎮](http://trackmania.com/) , I'm working currently with [docker 🐳](https://www.docker.com/) to build easy to deploy server app, and to manage these docker container I build a web app with [vuejs](https://vuejs.org/) and an api with the [nestjs](https://nestjs.com/) framework. This project is still private and dunno when he will be public :wink: ! 

* By talking [Trackmania 🎮](http://trackmania.com/), I have also started a multiplayer editor plugin, but since maniascript api isn't fully complete, so this project was never finished and still on hold : [Grand 2 - Trackmania Multiplayer Editor](https://github.com/LeGmask/Grand-2)

* Also, I love new things, even if they are useless. So for my Numworks Calculator I've started to help a fork of the OS [Epsilon](https://github.com/numworks/epsilon), [Omega](https://github.com/Omega-Numworks/Omega).

* The other project are more little project, more funny project and if you are interested by my project you can take a look :yum: !
