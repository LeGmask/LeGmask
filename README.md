# Hi there 👋, It's LeGmask !


## 😄 Who am I ?
I'm Evan, a French student born in Côtes-d'Armor (Bretagne, France), I have discovered programing in 2018 and since I'm learning a lot every day. 

* 📚 Lycée général @ Guiguamp
* 📍 Pleurisy - Côtes-d'Armor - Bretagne - France

## 🚧 What's my current work ?

* Passionate by [Trackmania 🎮](http://trackmania.com/) , I'm working currently with [docker 🐳](https://www.docker.com/) to build easy to deploy server app, and to manage these docker containers, I've built a web app with [Vuejs](https://vuejs.org/) and an API , with the [nestjs](https://nestjs.com/) framework. This project is still private and dunno when he will be public :wink: 

* By talking [Trackmania 🎮](http://trackmania.com/), I have also started a multiplayer editor plugin, but since manuscript API isn't fully complete, so this project was never finished and is still on hold : [Grand 2 - Trackmania Multiplayer Editor](https://github.com/LeGmask/Grand-2)

* Also, I love new things, even if they are useless. So for my Numworks Calculator I've started to help a fork of the OS [Epsilon](https://github.com/numworks/epsilon), [Omega](https://github.com/Omega-Numworks/Omega).

* Other projects are littler projects, funnier projects and if these projects interest you, you can take a look to my Github repository :Yum:

## Things I loveheart:

* Language : 
  - JavaScript / Typescript
  - C
  - C++
  - Bash
* Framework :
  - VueJs
  - NestJs

## Some open 🔓 source project where I collaborate ?

* [Schoolsyst](https://github.com/schoolsyst)
