# Hi there 👋, It's LeGmask !


## 😄 Who am I ?
I'm Evann, a French student born in Côtes-d'Armor (Bretagne, France), I have discovered programing in 2018 and since I'm learning a lot every day. 

* 📚 Lycée général @ Guiguamp
* 📍 Plouisy - Côtes-d'Armor - Bretagne - France

## 🚧 What's my current work ?

* Passionate by [Trackmania 🎮](http://trackmania.com/) , I'm working currently with [docker 🐳](https://www.docker.com/) to build easy to deploy server app, and to manage these docker containers.

* By talking [Trackmania 🎮](http://trackmania.com/), I have also started a multiplayer editor plugin, but since manuscript API isn't fully complete, so this project was never finished and is still on hold : [Grand 2 - Trackmania Multiplayer Editor](https://github.com/LeGmask/Grand-2)

* Also, I love new things, even if they are useless. So for my Numworks Calculator I've started to help a fork of the OS [Epsilon](https://github.com/numworks/epsilon), [Omega](https://github.com/Omega-Numworks/Omega).

* To facilitate the use of my computer in class, I've build a [desktop](https://github.com/schoolsyst/desktop) version of [schoolsyst wepapp](https://github.com/schoolsyst/webapp) using [electron](https://www.electronjs.org/). 

* Recently, I've build my own [website/protfolio](https://github.com/LeGmask/portfolio) ^^, for this project i've used [react ⚛️](https://reactjs.org/).

* Other projects are littler projects, funnier projects and if these projects interest you, you can take a look to my Github repository :yum: !

## Things I love :heart:

* Language : 
  - JavaScript / Typescript
  - C
  - C++
  - Bash
  - php
  - python
* Framework :
  - React
  - Laravel
  - VueJs
  - NestJs
